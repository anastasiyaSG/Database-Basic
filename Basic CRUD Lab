Lab: Basic CRUD
This document defines the lab assignments for the "Databases Basics - MySQL" course @ Software University. 
Download and get familiar with the hospital database schemas and tables. You will use it in the following exercises to write queries.
Problem 1: Select Employee Information
Write a query to select all employees and retrieve information about their id, first_name, last_name and job_title ordered by id.

Example
id	first_name	last_name	job_title

…	…	…	…


SELECT id, first_name, last_name,job_title
FROM employees
ORDER BY id;
Problem 2: Select Employees with Filter
Write a query to select all employees (id, first_name, last_name, job_title, salary) whose salaries are higher than 1000.00, ordered by id. Concatenate fields first_name and last_name into ‘full_name’.
Example
id	full_name	job_title	salary
3	Smith Johnson	Technician	1100
4	Peter Petrov	Supervisor	1100
5	Peter Ivanov	Dentist	1500.23
7	Jack Jackson	Epidemiologist	1800
…	…	…	…
SELECT concat(`first_name`,' ',`last_name`)
as 'full_name',
`job_title` AS 'job_title',
`salary` AS 'salary'
from `employees` where salary >1000;
Problem 3: Update Employees Salary
Update all employees salaries whose job_title is “Therapist” by 10%. Retrieve information about all salaries ordered ascending.


UPDATE employees
SET Salary = Salary*1.10
WHERE employees.job_title IN (
   
  'Therapist');


Example
Salary
880
990
1089
1100
…

Problem 4: Top Paid Employee
Write a query to create a view that selects all information about the top paid employee from the “employees” table in the hospital database.
Example
id	first_name	last_name	job_title	department_id	salary
8	Pedro	Petrov	Medical Director	3	2100


CREATE VIEw v_top_paid_employee  AS
SELECT*
FROM employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 1;

С Alter се модифицира вюто.
Когато се показват неща от две и повече таблици се използва join:

SELECT e.first_name,
e.last_name,e.salary,d.name
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d
on d.id = e.department_id
ORDER BY salary DESc;

Problem 5: Select Employees by Multiple Filters
Write a query to retrieve information about employees, who are in department 4 and have salary higher or equal to 1600. Order the information by id.

SELECT*FROM employees
where department_id = 4
and salary>=1600
order by id;
Example
id	first_name	last_name	job_title	department_id	salary
7	Jack	Jackson	Epidemiologist	4	1800
9	Nikolay	Ivanov	Nutrition Technician	4	1600

Problem 6: Delete from Table
Write a query to delete all employees from the “employees” table who are in department 2 or 1. Order the information by id.
DELETE from `employees`
where department_id=1
or department_id =2;
Select*From employees
Order by id;
